## Description

An ASP.NET web application that calculates college tuition fees. I created this application for an ASP.NET class I completed in community college. I decided to share this project and <a href="http://tuitioncalculator.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">host it on Azure</a> as well as share the code here on GitHub.

The application calculates and displays college tuition fees based on the user's residency status, the number of credits they are taking, and if they're registering late or not.

##	Usage

Feel free to do whatever you want with this project. I'm not planning on changing or updating it.
